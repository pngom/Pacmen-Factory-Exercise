This project is an assignment that I completed to fulfill the requirements of the [MIT Professional Certificate in Coding using MERN.](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding?u)  

It helped put to work fundamental Javascript concepts like Conditionals, Functions, Scope, Arrays, etc. The output is pretty fun!


## Repository File Structure
There are 6 files listed in this repository. All files are required to run the Pacmen Factory: 

* [index.html](https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/index.html)
* [pacmen.js](https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/pacmen.js)
* [images folder](https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/tree/main/images) containing the four Pacmen image files
  * **PacMan1,png** <img src="https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/images/PacMan1.png" alt="Pacmen Factory Exercise" width="2%">
  * **PacMan2,png** <img src="https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/images/PacMan2.png" alt="Pacmen Factory Exercise" width="2%">
  * **PacMan3,png** <img src="https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/images/PacMan3.png" alt="Pacmen Factory Exercise" width="2%">
  * **PacMan4,png** <img src="https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/images/PacMan4.png" alt="Pacmen Factory Exercise" width="2%">

It is important to keep the same file structure when dowloading the files to run the Pacmen Factory on your local computer. The html, javascript (.js) and images folder should be kept in the same directory. Note that the images files are used in the javascript file which is called by the html file. Therefore the program will not run if the files are renamed unless the file references are updated accordingly. 


## How to run the Pacmen Factory
1. Download the index.html, pacmen.js and images folder to the same directory on your computer
2. Open an Internet browser window (e.g. using Google Chrome) and drag and drop the index.html onto the page
3. Two buttons are displayed on the upper left corner of the page:
    1. First click on the button "Start Game"
    2. Second click on the button "Add PacMan" to add a Pacman. To add more pacmen click on the same button "Add PacMan" as many times as you want. More clicks = more fun!
