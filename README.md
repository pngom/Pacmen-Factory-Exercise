This project is an assignment that I completed to fulfill the requirements of the [MIT Professional Certificate in Coding using MERN.](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding?u)  

It helped put to work fundamental Javascript concepts like Conditionals, Functions, Scope, Arrays, etc. The output is pretty fun!

The assignment was about creating a game with lots of PacMan, all moving around freely with their mouth opened and closed, bouncing of both the vertical and horizontal walls. The user can add PacMan at any time.

## Repository File Structure
There are six files required to run the Pacmen Factory. All six files are listed in this repository: 

* **[index.html](https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/index.html)**
* **[pacmen.js](https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/pacmen.js)**
* [images folder](https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/tree/main/images) containing the four Pacmen image files
  * **PacMan1,png** <img src="https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/images/PacMan1.png" alt="Pacmen Factory Exercise" width="2%">
  * **PacMan2,png** <img src="https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/images/PacMan2.png" alt="Pacmen Factory Exercise" width="2%">
  * **PacMan3,png** <img src="https://github.com/pngom/Pacmen-Factory-Exercise/blob/main/images/PacMan3.png" alt="Pacmen Factory Exercise" width="2%">

## How to run the Pacmen Factory
It is important to keep the same file structure when dowloading the files to run the Pacmen Factory on your local computer. The html, javascript (.js) and images folder should be kept in the same directory. Note that the images files are used in the javascript file which is called by the html file. Therefore the program will not run if the files are renamed unless the file references are updated accordingly. 

1. Download the index.html, pacmen.js and images folder to the same directory on your computer
2. Open an Internet browser window (e.g. using Google Chrome) and drag and drop the index.html onto the page
3. Two buttons are displayed on the upper left corner of the page:
    1. First click on the button "Start Game"
    2. Second click on the button "Add PacMan" to add a Pacman. To add more pacmen click on the same button "Add PacMan" as many times as you want. More clicks = more fun! 


## Roadmap of future improvements
Build features to reproduce the basic original Pacman game:
- control Pacman instead of random movements
- add paths to make a maze
- add four colored objects (ghosts) that Pacman must avoid 
- add dots that Pacman must eat on its path to gain points
- Including 4 large dots called "Power Pellets". Eating these makes ghosts turn blue allowing Pacman to eat them for bonus points
